## Risk Mitigation Checklist

### Technical Risks

- [ ] **Agentverse downtime:** Test deployment early, have local fallback
- [ ] **API rate limits:** Implement exponential backoff, caching
- [ ] **Agent communication failures:** Comprehensive error handling, retry logic
- [ ] **MeTTa learning curve:** Start Day 1, focus on one clear use case
- [ ] **Demo day bugs:** Extensive testing, recorded backup demo

### Timeline Risks

- [ ] **Scope creep:** Strict feature freeze after Day 18
- [ ] **Technical debt:** Daily code review and refactoring
- [ ] **Last-minute issues:** 2-day buffer before deadline
- [ ] **Video editing delays:** Start video production Day 19

### Quality Risks

- [ ] **Poor documentation:** Write as you build, not at the end
- [ ] **Unpolished UX:** User test early and often
- [ ] **Weak demo narrative:** Script and rehearse multiple times
- [ ] **Missing requirements:** Review this checklist weekly
