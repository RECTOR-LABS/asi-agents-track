## About Artificial Superintelligence Alliance

The Artificial Superintelligence (ASI) Alliance unites [Fetch.ai](http://fetch.ai/), SingularityNET, Ocean Protocol, and CUDOS to build a decentralized, ethical, and accessible AI ecosystem. Together, we're pioneering the future of artificial intelligence and Web3 innovation.

## Challenge Statement

**Build Autonomous AI Agents with the ASI Alliance**

This is your opportunity to develop AI agents that don't just execute code—they perceive, reason, and act across decentralized systems. The **ASI Alliance** in partnership with [**Fetch.ai**](http://fetch.ai/) **Innovation Lab**, brings together world-class infrastructure from [**Fetch.ai**](http://fetch.ai/) and **SingularityNET** to support the next generation of modular, autonomous AI systems.

Use [**Fetch.ai**](http://fetch.ai/) **'s** [uAgents framework](https://github.com/fetchai/uAgents) or your preferred agentic stack to build agents that can interpret natural language, make decisions, and trigger real-world actions. Deploy them to [Agentverse](https://agentverse.ai/), the ASI-wide registry and orchestration layer where agents connect, collaborate, and self-organize.

Enhance your agents with structured knowledge from [SingularityNET's MeTTa](https://metta-lang.dev/docs/learn/tutorials/python_use/metta_python_basics.html) Knowledge Graph. For agent discovery and human interaction, integrate the [Chat Protocol](https://innovationlab.fetch.ai/resources/docs/agent-communication/agent-chat-protocol?_gl=1*kj0g16*_ga*ODM2NTgwNzAxLjE3NDAzOTY5MjQ.*_ga_0C55J9N0FX*czE3NTQ0ODAyMDQkbzE5OSRnMSR0MTc1NDQ4MDI4NiRqNjAkbDAkaDA.) to make your agents accessible through the [ASI:One](https://asi1.ai/) interface.

Whether you're building in healthcare, logistics, finance, education, or DeAI-native applications—this is your launchpad. Develop agents that talk to each other. That learn and adapt. That drive real outcomes across sectors.

The future of decentralized AI isn't siloed. It's composable, cross-chain, and powered by the **ASI Alliance**.

## Quick Start Example

This file can be run on any platform supporting Python, with the necessary install permissions. This example shows two agents communicating with each other using the uAgent python library.

[Try it out on Agentverse ↗](https://agentverse.ai/)

```python
from datetime import datetime
from uuid import uuid4
from uagents.setup import fund_agent_if_low
from uagents_core.contrib.protocols.chat import (
    ChatAcknowledgement,
    ChatMessage,
    EndSessionContent,
    StartSessionContent,
    TextContent,
    chat_protocol_spec,
)

agent = Agent()

# Initialize the chat protocol with the standard chat spec
chat_proto = Protocol(spec=chat_protocol_spec)

# Utility function to wrap plain text into a ChatMessage
def create_text_chat(text: str, end_session: bool = False) -> ChatMessage:
    content = [TextContent(type="text", text=text)]
    return ChatMessage(
        timestamp=datetime.utcnow(),
        msg_id=uuid4(),
        content=content,
    )

# Handle incoming chat messages
@chat_proto.on_message(ChatMessage)
async def handle_message(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: ChatMessage):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received message from {sender}")

    # Always send back an acknowledgement when a message is received
    await ctx.send(sender, ChatAcknowledgement(timestamp=datetime.utcnow(), acknowledged_msg_id=msg.msg_id))

    # Process each content item inside the chat message
    for item in msg.content:
        # Marks the start of a chat session
        if isinstance(item, StartSessionContent):
            ctx.logger.info(f"Session started with {sender}")

        # Handles plain text messages (from another agent or ASI:One)
        elif isinstance(item, TextContent):
            ctx.logger.info(f"Text message from {sender}: {item.text}")
            #Add your logic
            # Example: respond with a message describing the result of a completed task
            response_message = create_text_chat("Hello from Agent")
            await ctx.send(sender, response_message)

        # Marks the end of a chat session
        elif isinstance(item, EndSessionContent):
            ctx.logger.info(f"Session ended with {sender}")
        # Catches anything unexpected
        else:
            ctx.logger.info(f"Received unexpected content type from {sender}")

# Handle acknowledgements for messages this agent has sent out
@chat_proto.on_message(ChatAcknowledgement)
async def handle_acknowledgement(ctx: Context, sender: str, msg: ChatAcknowledgement):
    ctx.logger.info(f"Received acknowledgement from {sender} for message {msg.acknowledged_msg_id}")

# Include the chat protocol and publish the manifest to Agentverse
agent.include(chat_proto, publish_manifest=True)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    agent.run()
```
